          <h2>About Jake</h2>
            <p>After graduating from Clemson University, I began working as a Project Manager before making my way to the financial industry. I discovered my passion for coding while trying to create a website for my mother's business. I started studying the basics of HTML and CSS and found I really enjoyed the creative process of developing a website.</p>
            <p>I began my time as a student in March of 2021 and it has gone exceedingly well. I enjoyed learning the basics of Javascript and looking forward to becoming a Software Engineer!</p>
            <p>I have enjoyed playing music, in particular the drums, for the last 16 years and recenlty taught myself the piano. When I run into a problem that requires me time to think of a solution I like to go outside and ride my electric bike to clear my head.</p>
